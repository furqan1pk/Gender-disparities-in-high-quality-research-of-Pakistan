# Gender Disparities in High-Quality Research of Pakistan

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze gender disparities in high-quality research in Pakistan from 1947 to 2020. It scrutinizes the gender disparity in authorship by utilizing bibliometric data from Scopus and gender metrics determined through the Namsor API. The study includes analysis of authorship patterns, discipline-wise distribution, international collaborations, and the overall gender-based research landscape in Pakistan.

## Technologies and APIs Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy`: Used for numerical computations in statistical analysis and data manipulation.
  - `pandas`: Utilized for data analysis and manipulation, especially for handling tabular data like research papers' details.
  - `re (Regular Expressions)`: Important for processing and cleaning text data, such as author names or institutional affiliations.
  - `math`: Provides mathematical functions for calculations like percentages or ratios in gender disparity studies.
  - `time`: Used for measuring performance or handling date and time data.
  - `sys`: Helpful for system-specific parameters and functions in script configuration.
  - `csv`: Essential for reading and writing CSV files, a common format in data analysis projects.
  - `pprint`: Improves the readability of output, particularly in complex data structures.
  - `openapi_client`: Specific to interacting with the Namsor API for gender determination.

- **API:**
  - **Namsor API:** Used for gender determination based on author names, a critical step in analyzing gender disparities in research authorship.

## Data Processing and Analysis Techniques
- **Gender Determination:** The Namsor API was employed to determine the gender of authors based on their names, a fundamental aspect of gender disparity analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project likely involved extensive data preprocessing, including cleaning, filtering, and structuring the Scopus dataset for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Various statistical techniques were applied to assess gender disparities across decades, disciplines, and authorship positions.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Data visualizations, generated using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, were used to present findings effectively. These visualizations may include charts, graphs, and heatmaps.
- **Text Analysis:** The `re` library was used for text analysis, likely for extracting author names, affiliations, and other relevant information from the dataset.
